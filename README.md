# Introduction to Salesforce DX - DevTrails ZÃ¼rich

This repo is a clone of https://github.com/Szandor72/LightningWorkbench stripped to bare DX basics. The original packaged source can be found in './packaged'

## Dev, Build and Test
We will be using circle ci 2.0 for the purposes of this exercise. All the fun stuff you can do with DX is somewhat scripted in 'commands.txt'
